It can also be downloaded and installed using the ndtv:::check.mdsj() function. 

MDSJ is a free Java library for Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).

It is a free, non-graphical, self-contained, lightweight implementation of basic MDS algorithms and intended to be used both as a standalone application and as a building block in Java based data analysis and visualization software.

It is developed at the University of Konstanz, Department of Computer & Information Science, Algorithmics Group. It is free for academic and research purposes; no registration is required. See the License Conditions below for the conditions of use.

The current version is v0.2 [2009-11-18]. It does not depend on a specific operating system or platform, but merely requires a runtime environment of Java 1.5 or higher to be installed on your system.

For detailed information on methods and background, see C. Pich, Applications of Multidimensional Scaling to Graph Drawing, PhD thesis, University of Konstanz, 2009.
